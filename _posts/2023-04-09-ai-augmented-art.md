## Intro and Motivations

Recently, I've been interested in the capabilities of AI Art. I bought a month's subscription of Midjourney and went to work.

I wanted to create some art of my MapleLegends character, Alouph, who is a mermaid:

I decided I wanted off the bat that I wanted the art to be semi-realistic, so I started off with this prompt:

```

```

I really liked the pose on this one, and spent about an hour trying to render a version where she had a visible mermaid tail instead of a scarf or sash. Unfortunately, it wasn't able to be done, so I went ahead and rerolled the prompt about four more times until I saw a version that had potential:

The top left image had the right sort of feel, so I upscaled it. I rerolled this upscale version a few times until I found a version with a face that "felt" like my character.

I was pretty happy with this, however, I also immediately noticed that her hands were not generated correctly. One of the biggest weaknesses for AI is the ability to draw hands, likely due to the fact that humans also generally have trouble drawing hands. 

Additionally, I also noticed that while this image was great as a base, the character did not look like mine. I did try to reroll multiple images based off this one containing the characteristics I wanted ("fish hat", "star-shaped staff") but ultimately after a couple hours I still was unable to get what I needed.

What I ended up doing next might shock you - in the end, to get the fish hat that I wanted, I had to quickly composite together a fish hat and reran it through the AI with this prompt: 

```

```

... which ultimately got me the fish hat that I needed:

... and here is a small gallery of a SMALL selection of the rejected fish hats:

In the end, I still had to take the time to manually extract the fish hat and edit it into the image with Photoshop.

There are other images I generated to steal from:

It was at this point I really wondered if AI was going to take a digital artist's job, since there was still so much editing work necessary.

In the end, I wasn't actually able to generate a mermaid with proper hand anatomy, so I had to spend a couple hours redrawing the hands myself.

Hope you enjoy the final result! In the end, it still took about 8 hours to generate, stitch together, edit, and polish the images, so this still ended up being a process that involved a lot of manual work. That said, I am completely satisfied with the result, especially since an image of this quality would normally take me about 18-24 hours to draw myself. :) I learned a lot from this experiment and hope to get the entire process down to about 2 hours a composite.
